              first and most important criterion is pixel density: the statistic
              that generally gives the best idea of a screenâ€™s sharpness.If it
              did that and nothing else, however, there would be a problem. User
              interface elements like menus and icons would look tiny. To
              compensate for this, Apple created what it calls HiDPI mode, where
              each interface element is doubled in size vertically and
              horizontally and so appears at the same size as it would on a
              non-Retina display.
